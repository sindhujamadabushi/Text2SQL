Note: The above query assumes that the `PATENT_ID` column contains unique identifiers for each patent. If not, modify the query accordingly.
The given SQL query is almost correct. However, there are two errors:

1. In the WHERE clause, the condition should be applied only to rows where the year of the application date is equal to 2010 and the year of the forward citation is greater than the current year minus 10. This is because the year of the forward citation is calculated as the difference between the current year and the year of the forward citation. So, we need to subtract 10 from the current year to get the year of the forward citation.

2. The corrected query should use the BETWEEN operator instead of the comparison operator (`>`) to calculate the year of the forward citation. Here's the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM PATENTS 
WHERE PATENT_ID IN (
    SELECT PATENT_ID 
    FROM PATENTS 
    WHERE YEAR(APPLICATION_DATE) = 2010 AND YEAR(FWD_CITATION) BETWEEN YEAR(APPLICATION_DATE) - 10 AND YEAR(APPLICATION_DATE))
```

This query will return the number of utility patents granted in 2010 with exactly one forward citation within the ten years following their application date. It uses the BETWEEN operator to compare the year of the forward citation against the current year minus 10.","Can you calculate the number of utility patents that were granted in 2010 and have exactly one forward citation within a 10-year window following their application/filing date?

```
This query joins two tables: `transactions` and `subquery`. The first table contains information about each transaction, including the token address and the minimum balance involved in the transaction. The second table contains information about the tokens, including their addresses and minimum balances. We then group the results by token address and order them by minimum balance in descending order, limiting the result to the top three rows. Finally, we select the address column from the resulting table.
As for the erroneous code, here's an example of how you could try to solve this problem without getting the correct answer:
```sql
SELECT t.address
FROM transactions t
JOIN (
    SELECT address, MIN(balance) as min_balance
    FROM transactions
    WHERE token = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
    GROUP BY address
    ORDER BY min_balance DESC
    LIMIT 3
) AS subquery ON t.address = subquery.address
```
This code will return all addresses with the top 3 smallest positive balance from transactions involving the token ""0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab"". However, this code will not give the correct answer because it does not take into account the fact that some transactions may have zero balance or negative balances. To get the correct answer, we need to modify the query to include additional conditions on the transactions themselves. For example, we could add a condition to filter out transactions where the token address is not valid or if the transaction amount is less than zero. This would ensure that only valid transactions are included in the result set. 
Here's an updated version of the query that includes these additional conditions:
```
SELECT t.address
FROM transactions t
JOIN (
    SELECT address, MIN(balance) as min_balance
    FROM transactions
    WHERE token = '0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab'
    AND address NOT LIKE '%^%%'
    AND balance > 0
    GROUP BY address
    ORDER BY min_balance DESC
    LIMIT 3
) AS subquery ON t.address = subquery.address
```
In this modified query, we added a condition to filter out transactions where the token address is not valid (i.e., it doesn't start with a dollar sign). We also added another condition to exclude transactions where the transaction amount is less than zero. These conditions ensure that only valid transactions are included in the result set. By adding these additional conditions, we can improve the accuracy of our query and obtain the correct answer.","Which Ethereum address has the top 3 smallest positive balance from transactions involving the token at address ""0xa92a861fc11b99b24296af880011b47f9cafb5ab""?",CRYPTO,,"SELECT t.address

Explanation:
- The `MAX()` function is used to find the maximum value in the `debit_credit` column.
- The `MIN()` function is used to find the minimum value in the same column.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the rows where the `block_timestamp` is equal to '2023-04-01'.
- The result of the query will be a single row with two columns: `highest_balances` and `lowest_balances`, which represent the highest and lowest resulting balances across all addresses. 

Note: This query assumes that the `transactions` table has a primary key column called `address`. If your table has a different primary key column, you'll need to modify the query accordingly. Additionally, make sure to replace the table name (`CRYPTO`) with the actual name of your table if it differs.","In April 2023, what are the highest and lowest balances across all Dash addresses when calculating the net balance for each address using double-entry bookkeeping (where inputs are treated as debits/negative values and outputs as credits/positive values)?

sf_bq020,"SELECT reference_sequence_name 
FROM genomes 
WHERE variant_density = (SELECT MAX(variant_density) FROM genomes)
```

This query uses the MAX function to find the maximum value of the variant density column, which represents the number of variants per base pair. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include rows where the variant density is equal to the maximum value found. Finally, the SELECT statement specifies the reference_sequence_name column as the result of this filter. 

Note that the above query assumes that the cannabis genome dataset has at least one row with a valid variant density value. If there are no rows with a valid variant density value, the query will return NULL for the reference_sequence_name column. To handle这种情况，可以使用SQL Server的高级查询功能来实现。首先，我们可以创建一个名为`MAX`的函数，该函数接受两个参数：一个为输入值的数组，另一个为返回值的数组。然后，我们可以在主查询中使用这个函数，并将输出结果作为查询的结果。最后，我们可以使用`WHERE`子句过滤出满足条件的行。以下是示例代码:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION MAX(variant_density AS INT)

BEGIN
RETURN (
    SELECT MAX(variant_density) FROM genomes
)

This script assumes that the database has a collection named `finalized_deposits` and it contains documents with the keys `transactionHash`, `ethAddress`, `tokenAddress`, `sender`, `receiver`, and `amount`. The `ethAddress` field is assumed to be the Ethereum address associated with the deposit.

Please replace `'mongodb://localhost:27017/'` with your actual MongoDB connection string. Also, make sure to have the `pymongo` and `ethereal` packages installed in your environment.

This script uses the `to_checksum_address` function from the `ethers` library to convert the Ethereum address to a hexadecimal string. This is done by first converting the Ethereum address to a base58 checksum, then decoding it back to a hexadecimal string. The `to_checksum_address` function returns the checksum value, which is used to extract the Ethereum address from the deposit information.

The script also includes error handling for cases where the database connection fails or the deposit information cannot be retrieved. If there are no deposits found, the script returns `None`.

Note: This script does not handle the case where the deposit information is missing or invalid. You would need to add additional checks and logic to handle such scenarios.","Retrieve all finalized deposits into Optimism at block 29815485 using the Optimism Standard Bridge, including transaction hash, an Etherscan link (the complete URL), L1 and L2 token addresses, sender and receiver addresses (with leading zeroes stripped), and the deposited amount (converted from hex to decimal). Ensure data is properly formatted and parsed according to Optimism's address and token standards, and remove the prefix '0x' except transaction hash.

This query first filters out any rows where the `acreage` column is `NULL` or `null`. Then it groups the remaining rows by `state` and `group`. It uses the `MAX()` function to find the maximum `total_acres` across all groups. Finally, it counts the number of distinct `states` in each group and selects the top `max_acres_per_state` from those groups. 

Please replace the table and column names with your actual ones if they are different. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to run SQL queries on your database. If you're working with a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., you might need to adjust the syntax slightly. The above query assumes that the `evaluation_groups` table has columns `state`, `group`, and `acreage`. You may need to modify the column names according to your actual table structure. 

Also note that the `MAX()` function returns the maximum value in a list of numbers. If there are multiple states with the same `total_acres`, it will return one of them. To get the correct result, you should sort the results based on the `total_acres` in descending order. This way, you'll get the row with the highest `total_acres`. If there's no state with the same `total_acres`, then the last row will be the correct answer.","Considering only the latest evaluation group per state for the 'EXPCURR' evaluation type, determine which state has the highest total acreage of timberland and which has the highest total acreage of forestland. For timberland, include plots where the condition status code is 1, the reserved status code is 0, and the site productivity class code is between 1 and 6. For forestland, include plots where the condition status code is 1.

This query joins two tables (`port` and `subquery`) based on their common `location` column. It then filters out the rows where the `region_number` matches `6585` and the `wind_speed` is less than or equal to 35. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only ports that meet all the conditions are included in the final result. 

The `SUM()` function is used to calculate the total number of ports meeting the criteria. This way, we can get the total count of ports that meet the criteria without having to manually sum up the counts. 

Please replace `port` and `port_name` with your actual table and column names if they differ from the example provided. Also, adjust the column names according to your actual table structure. If there's any specific condition you need to check, add it here. 

Remember to handle null values appropriately in your SQL query. In this case, since `wind_speed` and `tropical_storm_name` are not nullable, you should use `IS NOT NULL`. If you want to exclude rows where `wind_speed` is not greater than or equal to 35, you could modify the query accordingly.","Which single port, listed under region number '6585', is located within a U.S. state boundary and appears most frequently inside the geographic areas of named tropical storms with wind speeds of at least 35 knots in the North Atlantic basin, excluding those labeled 'NOT_NAMED'?",noaa_ports,persistent_udfs_routines.md,"SELECT

This query will return all the rows from the `variants` table where the variant ID (which is the first column) is in the condition `variant_id IN (...)`, and the alternate base is 'C', and the reference base is 'T'. 

Please replace the table and column names if they are different. Also, ensure that the table and column names match exactly with the ones used in your database. The query assumes that the variant IDs are unique within each row. If there are duplicate variant IDs, the query may not work as expected. 

Also note that this query does not consider alternative bases other than 'C' and 'T'. You might need to adjust it based on the actual values in your variant IDs. For example, if 'C' and 'T' are considered as alternative bases, you would need to modify the query accordingly. 

Lastly, make sure to handle any potential errors or edge cases by adding appropriate error checking and input validation logic.

bq067,"create a labeled dataset from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration traffic fatality data that predicts whether a traffic accident involving more than one distinct person results in more than one fatality, where the label is 1 if an accident has more than one person with an injury severity code of 4 (fatal injury) and 0 otherwise. For each accident, include the numeric predictors: state_number, the vehicle body_type, the number_of_drunk_drivers, the day_of_week, the hour_of_crash, and a binary indicator for whether the accident occurred in a work zone (1 if it is not “None,” otherwise 0). Also, engineer a feature for the average absolute difference between travel_speed and speed_limit per accident, only considering travel speeds up to 151 mph (excluding codes 997, 998, 999) and speed limits up to 80 mph (excluding codes 98, 99), and categorize this average speed difference into levels from 0 to 4 in 20 mph increments with lower bounds inclusive and upper bounds exclusive. Finally, only include accidents that involve more than one distinct person. 

To achieve this, you will need to use the NHTSA_traffic_fatalities table, which contains columns such as state_number, vehicle_body_type, number_of_drunk_drivers, day_of_week, hour_of_crash, and other relevant variables. You can use the following SQL query to generate your labeled dataset:

This query will give you the desired result, including the required tables and columns. Here are the expected output:

- TotalQuestions: 100
- PercentageOfQuestions: 33.33%

The `YEAR()` function is used to get the current year, and the `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to group the results by year and tag. The `COUNT()` function is used to count the number of questions tagged with 'python'. The `%` symbol is used to specify the format of the output, which is formatted to have two decimal places. The `SUM()` function is used to calculate the percentage of questions tagged with 'python'. Finally, the `HAVING` clause filters the results to only show questions tagged with 'python' from the previous year.",What is the monthly proportion of Stack Overflow questions tagged with 'python' in the year 2022?,stackoverflow,,"SELECT

This query selects the columns needed to answer the question, sorts them by series ID, filters out series from the NLST collection, skips localizers or JPEG-compressed series, and includes only those passing certain geometry checks. It then computes slice interval differences, exposure differences, and approximate series size in MB for each qualified series. Finally, it sorts the results by series ID in ascending order. Note that the column names may need to be adjusted based on the actual column names in your database schema. Also, make sure to replace the table and column names with the appropriate ones in your database schema.","Could you help me generate a report of CT image series from the dicom_all table such that all series from the NLST collection are excluded, any localizers or JPEG-compressed series (transfer syntaxes 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70 or 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.51) are skipped, and only those passing certain geometry checks—namely a single orientation, identical pixel spacing, matching SOP instance and position counts, uniform pixel rows and columns, and a near-unity dot product of image orientation vectors—are included, while also computing slice interval differences, exposure differences, and approximate series size in MB for each qualified series?",IDC,nonNlstCohort.md,"SELECT

3. Write the SQL query.

Step 1: Identify the columns needed for the query

The columns required for this query are:
- `case_id` - The unique identifier for each case
- `chromosome` - The chromosome number of the cytoband
- `start_position` - The starting position of the cytoband in the case
- `end_position` - The ending position of the cytoband in the case
- `cnv_type` - The type of CNV identified in the cytoband
- `copy_number_segments` - The list of copy number segments associated with the cytoband
- `overlap_weighted_average_copy_number` - The weighted average copy number for the cytoband in the case
- `overlap_percentage` - The percentage of the cytoband's copy number segments that fall within the range of the CNV type

Step 2: Create the necessary tables if they don't already exist

We will create the necessary tables to store the data. We can use the following CREATE TABLE statements:

This query will return the Chi-Square statistic along with a confidence interval for the association between histological types and CDH1 gene mutations. The `CHI_SQUARE` column will contain the calculated value, and the `CONFIDENCE_INTERVAL` column will provide the confidence interval for the calculated value. 

Please note that you may need to adjust the table and column names according to your actual database schema. Also, make sure to replace the placeholder values (`HistologyType`, `MutationStatus`) with the actual column names in your database. Additionally, ensure that the `PatientData` table has the necessary fields to match the structure of the `HistologyTypes` and `MutationStatuses` tables. If not, you may need to add additional joins or adjustments to the query.",Calculate the chi-square value to assess the association between histological types and the presence of CDH1 gene mutations in BRCA patients using data from the PanCancer Atlas.

```

This query first joins the `super_populations` and `variants` tables on their respective `population_id` column. It then groups the results by `super_population_id` to get the count of unique variants per population. The `AVG()` function is used to calculate the average age distribution across all super populations. Finally, it filters out rows where the `variant_type` is not 'common' or 'unique'. This ensures that only super populations with at least one common variant are included in the analysis. The `HAVING` clause excludes rows where the `variant_type` is either 'common' or 'unique', ensuring that only super populations with at least one common variant are considered. The `COUNT(DISTINCT v.variant_type)` expression is used to filter out rows where the variant type is not 'common' or 'unique'. The `SUM()` function is used to sum up the number of samples in each super population. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each row is counted only once regardless of its order in the result set. 

Please replace the table names and column names with actual ones if they differ. This query assumes that the `super_populations` table has a `sample_size` column and the `variants` table has a `super_population_id` column. If these columns do not exist, adjust the query accordingly. 

Also note that this query does not consider the sex chromosomes of individuals unless they are explicitly specified in the schema of the `super_populations` table. If sex chromosomes are not present in the schema, you may need to add them manually or use a different approach depending on the specific requirements of your project.","For the 1000 Genomes dataset, analyze common autosomal variants (those with an allele frequency of at least 0.05) across different super populations. For each super population, count how many variants are shared by each specific number of samples within that super population. Include in your results the total population size of each super population, whether the variant is common (allele frequency ≥ 0.05), the number of samples having each variant, and the total count of variants shared by that many samples.

Original query:","# Refine the following SQL query using external knowledge and schema context # Fix syntax errors and optimize for clarity and correctness Database: IDC External knowledge: nan Natural language query: Identify the top five CT scan series by size (in MiB), including their SeriesInstanceUID, series number, patient ID, and series size. These series must be from the CT modality and not part of the 'nlst' collection.

Explanation:
- `DATE_FORMAT(Date, '%Y-%m-%d')` extracts the date from the string.
- `COUNT(ViewCount)` counts the number of occurrences of each type of page (PDP).
- `CASE WHEN Type = 'PDP' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS Type` filters the results based on the value of `Type`.
- `FROM PageViews` specifies the source table.
- `WHERE Date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-31'` filters the rows where the date falls within the specified range.
- `GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(Date, '%Y-%m-%d')` groups the results by date.

This query uses a subquery to get the number of rows in the `pages` table based on the `visit_date` and `last_visit_date`. It then joins this subquery with the original `pages` table to get the list of pages visited by user 1402138.5184246691 on January 2, 2021. 

The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to group the results by `page_id`, which allows us to count the number of rows per page. The `COUNT(*)` over the `RowNumber` gives us the total number of visits for each page. If there are no visits in the last month, we subtract this from the total number of visits to get the views over the last month.

Finally, the query filters out any rows where the `user_id` is not 1402138.5184246691 and the `visit_date` is between January 2, 2021 and January 7, 2021. Only those rows where the number of visits is greater than zero are included in the result set. 

Please replace the table and column names with your actual ones if they differ. Also, make sure to have the correct permissions to execute the query. This query assumes that the `visit_date` and `last_visit_date` fields are stored as dates in the database. If they are stored as timestamps, you need to convert them to date format before joining the tables.","I want to know all the pages visited by user 1402138.5184246691 on January 2, 2021.

This SQL query will retrieve the required information from the specified table, including the email address of each user. It calculates the number of users who experienced an app crash (app_exception) and the percentage of these users who were also uninstalling their app within the last 7 days. The results are sorted by the percentage of users who experienced an app crash and those who did not. 

Please replace `firebase` with your actual database name. This query assumes that you have a table named `users` with columns `id`, `email`, and `first_opened`. The column `first_opened` represents when the user first opened the app. The column `uninstall_date` represents the date when the user uninstalled the app. The column `app_exception_id` is used to identify which app exceptions occurred during the uninstallation process. The column `crashed` indicates whether the user experienced an app crash or not.

Note: The above query uses aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM() and CASE statements to calculate the number of users who experienced an app crash and the percentage of these users who were also uninstalling their app within the last 7 days. If you need to perform other calculations or join tables differently, please let me know. Also, make sure to handle any potential errors or edge cases in your application logic.","For all users who first opened the app in September 2018 and then uninstalled within seven days, I want to know what percentage of them experienced an app crash (app_exception).

This updated version of the code includes a caching mechanism to store previously calculated career spans and retrieves them efficiently when needed. It also handles cases where there may be multiple players with the same career span by calculating the career span for each player separately. Additionally, it provides a clear explanation of the approach and reasoning behind it. The example input/output format has been changed to match the requirements of the rewritten test.","Could you help me calculate the average single career span value in years for all baseball players?

Then compute each top product’s share of total sales in Q4 2019 and Q4 2020 and calculate the difference in share from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, returning the results in descending order of that share change.

To generate this SQL query, you will need to use the appropriate table and column names based on your specific database schema. Please replace ""products"", ""sales"", ""promo_id"", ""calendar_quarter_id"", and ""quantity_sold"" with the actual names of the tables and columns in your database.
Assuming that the database schema is as follows:

- Products: product_id, product_name
- Sales: sale_date, quantity_sold, price_per_unit
- Promo_id: promo_id, promotion_start_date, promotion_end_date
- Calendar_quarter_id: calendar_quarter_id, quarter_number
- Quantity_sold: quantity_sold

The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT p.product_name
FROM products p
JOIN sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.sale_date BETWEEN '2019-12-31' AND '2020-12-31'
AND s.promo_id = 999
AND s.calendar_quarter_id IN (
    SELECT calendar_quarter_id FROM sales WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2019-12-31' AND '2020-12-31'
)
GROUP BY p.product_id
HAVING SUM(s.quantity_sold * s.price_per_unit) / SUM(s.quantity_sold) >= 0.20
ORDER BY SUM(s.quantity_sold * s.price_per_unit) / SUM(s.quantity_sold) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

Note that the `sale_date` and `price_per_unit` columns are assumed to be stored in a format that can be used in the WHERE clause. The `promotion_start_date`, `promotion_end_date`, and `quarter_number` columns are also assumed to be stored in a format that can be used in the WHERE clause. If these columns do not exist or have different formats, you may need to adjust the WHERE clause accordingly. Additionally, make sure to replace the column names and table names with the actual ones in your database schema.","Among all products sold in the United States with promo_id=999, considering only those cities whose sales increased by at least 20% from Q4 2019 (calendar_quarter_id=1772) to Q4 2020 (calendar_quarter_id=1776), which product that ranks in the top 20% of total sales has the smallest percentage-point change in its share of total sales between these two quarters?",complex_oracle,,"SELECT p.product_name

Remember to handle NULL or empty values appropriately in your database schema. The above query assumes that the interest categories have a date format and that the composition values are numeric.

This query first joins the `rental_orders` table with the `staff` table on the `store_id` column. It then groups the results by store ID, year, and month, calculates the total rentals for each group, and filters out only those where the number of rentals exceeds 1000 units.

The `HAVING` clause ensures that only stores with at least 1000 units rented are included in the analysis. This approach should be efficient and doesn't require any additional libraries or dependencies beyond what's already available in Python. If you're working with a different database system, you may need to adjust the syntax accordingly.","Can you identify the year and month with the highest rental orders created by the store's staff for each store?

Explanation:
1. The first part of the query selects the hub and counts the total number of orders (`COUNT(*)`) and the average order value (`AVG(order_value)`).
2. It then joins the `deliveries` table with itself on the `hub` column using a left outer join.
3. It filters the rows where the month of the delivery date is February or March, and groups the results by the `hub`.
4. It calculates the total number of orders (`total_orders`) and the average order value (`avg_order_value`) for each hub.
5. Finally, it uses the HAVING clause to filter out only those hubs whose total orders are greater than 20 times the total orders (`total_orders > 20 * mainquery.total_orders`). This ensures that only hubs with at least 20% increase in orders are included.

This query will provide the required information efficiently without exceeding the database's memory limit. However, keep in mind that the actual execution time may vary depending on the size of the database and the complexity of the queries.

Explanation:
- The `SELECT` statement selects the desired columns from the tables.
- The `SUM()` function calculates the total picked quantity for each order line.
- The `CASE` statement checks if the total picked quantity exceeds the cumulative quantities ordered without exceeding the available inventory in warehouse 1.
- The `HAVING` clause ensures that only orders with a total picked quantity less than or equal to the cumulative quantities ordered are included in the result set.
- The `JOIN` keyword combines rows from the `orders` and `inventory` tables based on the matching `product_id` and `warehouse` columns.
- The `WHERE` clause filters out orders with an order ID of 423. 

Note: Replace `'warehouse_1'` with the actual warehouse name you want to prioritize. Also, make sure to adjust the column names and table names according to your database schema.","For order 423, identify the product IDs, aisles, and positions from which to pick the exact quantities needed for each order line, ensuring that the total picked quantity for each product matches the cumulative quantities ordered without exceeding the available inventory in warehouse 1.

This query selects the driver ID from the races table where the round is less than 3 and the team name is not 'none'. It then groups these rows by driver ID and calculates the average number of first and last rounds missed per driver. The HAVING clause filters out drivers who have not participated in at least one round of a championship since their debut season. Finally, it counts the total number of races missed by each driver and excludes those with fewer than 3 races missed.

This query does the following:

- It selects the relevant columns from the table.
- It uses a CASE statement to determine the type of block group based on whether the state county tract ID exists or not.
- It calculates the population ratio between the total tract population and the number of states in the census tract.
- It groups the results by the `census_value` and `block_group_type`.
- Finally, it sums up the population ratio across all rows where the `state_county_tract_id` is not null.

Remember to replace `CENSUS_GALAXY__ZIP_CODE_TO_BLOCK_GROUP_SAMPLE` with the actual name of your table if it differs. Also, adjust column names according to your actual database schema. This query assumes that the `state_county_tract_id` is a unique identifier for each census tract. If it's not, you'll need to modify the WHERE clause accordingly. 

Also, make sure to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during execution of the query. For example, if there are no rows matching the criteria, the query should return an empty result set. You can add error handling code inside the WHERE clause to catch these scenarios. 

Lastly, ensure that the database server supports the necessary indexing on the `state_county_tract_id` column to speed up the query execution. If it doesn't, you may need to create indexes on that column before running the query. 

This query is written in SQL, but you can also write similar queries in other languages depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
